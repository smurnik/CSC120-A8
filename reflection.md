Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
  My class represents a Plant! At first it was a little tricky thinking of an example where all methods would apply. You can create a new plant and call methods for it. For example where would you like your plant? Somewhere entirely different? Fly it to a valid coordinate. Want to splice it? Call the shink method to see if it is old enough.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
  n/a
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  I thought this was a fun assignment because you could be creative with the idea. I think this assignment is a good transition to the final project because even with this assignment I can think of a lot of other things I could add to make it more interesting and interactive!
